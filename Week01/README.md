**Location:** Toronto, ON Canada

**Programming Experience:** Familiar with the fundementals of programming from university, but only started coding again after about 20 years.  Still pretty novice at this stage as I've been doing tutorials off and on for the last year or so.

**Programming Goals:** I'm hoping that by the end of this bootcamp, I'm proficient enough that I understand how to use some new fundamentals, and understand more efficient ways of getting things done.

I'd also like to have a better grasp on best practices for both patterns and workflow.

**Hobbies & Interests:** I love travelling (or used to pre-covid), music, and enjoy kicking back with the XBOX from time to time.  I'm also tinkering with an app of my own in my spare time. Otherwise I just love to get outside for long walks or bike rides.
